# Group_pokemon_game
group 3

Guidance:

* Work in your groups of 2-3 to make a single game
* API documentation: PokéAPI (pokeapi.co)
* Recommended: Understand the Pokemon lookup program first (code below) to fully understand accessing data from the API.
* The Pokémon data MUST come from the PokeApi
* Get random Pokémon for at least the CPU (Player can be chosen or random)
* Pokémon should fight and a winner should be declared in some way
* No Pygame. Focus on interacting with the API.
* Be as creative as you like after this. Can you incorporate different abilities/stats etc.?
* Try and work collaboratively on the one repo using Git
* To deliver: Give it your best shot! Share your code (message your Ramon + Luke directly, NOT a message in the main chat) by COB (17:00)
